The starting materials used for the synthesis of the Li9.6P3S12 solid electrolyte were Li2S ( >99.9% purity, Idemitsu Kosan), P2S5 ( >99% purity, Sigma Aldrich), and phosphorus ( >99% purity, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory). All of the procedures were conducted under an argon atmosphere inside a glove box. All of the reagents were weighed in the appropriate molar ratio and mixed by planetary ball milling for 120 h. The specimens were then pressed into pellets, sealed in a quartz tube at 10 Pa, and heated between 230 ∘C and 260 ∘C for 4 h in a furnace. After heating, the tube was slowly cooled to room temperature. The solid electrolyte, Li10GeP2S12, was prepared by sintering Li2S ( >99.9% purity, Nippon Chemical Industrial), P2S5 ( >99% purity, Sigma Aldrich) and GeS2 ( >99.99% purity, Kojundo Chemical Laboratory) in appropriate molar ratios. In the case of the solid electrolyte Li9.54Si1.74P1.44S11.7Cl0.3, Li2S ( >99.9% purity, Nippon Chemical Industrial), P2S5 ( >99% purity, Sigma Aldrich), SiS2 ( >98% purity, Alfa Aesar) and LiCl ( >99.9% purity, Kojundo Chemicals) were mixed in an appropriate molar ratio. The mixture was then placed in a ZrO2 pot containing a ZrO2 ball (ϕ10 mm), and the mixture was mechanically milled using the planetary ball milling apparatus at 370 r.p.m. for 40 h. Following the ball milling procedure, the mixture was placed in a quartz tube and heated at 475 ∘C for 8 h.
